## Neural Network Reference

* Implementing basic functionality of neural network, in order to internalize how this all works.
* Currently based on Numpy ndarrays / not suitable for actual training tasks.
* Much of my understanding and consequent implementation is a generalized form of the implementation worked through in Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### TO DO
1. Finish core functionality - want to be able to train a task
2. Breakout optimization into separate class to enable plugging in quasi-Newton / other optimization methods
3. Implement test error / validation error computations
4. Implement dropout and regularization
5. Clean / comment code and make it more literate so other people can use this to learn
6. Implement graphing of training process
7. Add softmax, ReLU layers 
8. Probably other things I'm forgetting at the moment ..
