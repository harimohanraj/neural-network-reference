* Implementing basic functionality of neural network, in order to internalize how this all works.
* Currently based on Numpy ndarrays / not suitable for actual training tasks.
* Much of my understanding and consequent implementation is a generalized form of the implementation worked through in Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning
