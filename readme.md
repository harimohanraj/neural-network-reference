## Neural Network Reference

* Implementing basic functionality of neural network, in order to internalize how this all works.
* Currently based on Numpy ndarrays / not suitable for actual training tasks.
* Much of my understanding and consequent implementation is a generalized form of the implementation worked through in Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning

* Made at the Recurse Center (Winter 2, 2016)
